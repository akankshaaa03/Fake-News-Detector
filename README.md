In today’s world, fake news has become a serious threat to many people. Fake News can be any news, story, or hoax that misinform people or deceive the readers. Social media apps like Facebook, Instagram, and even Google are how fake news is growing. 

There can be various causes behind the spreading of these false informations but these information shapes our world view: we make important decisions based on information. We form an idea about people or a situation by obtaining information. So if the information we saw on the Web is invented, false, exaggerated or distorted, we won’t make good decisions.
